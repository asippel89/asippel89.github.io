I'm a Seattle-based engineering manager who enjoys dance, tech, and cocktails. After 
graduating in physics in 2012 at the University of Chicago, I worked at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory
conducting research and building software for an experiment called the [Holometer](https://holometer.fnal.gov/). 

Following this, I took on a software engineering role at [Narrative Science](https://narrativescience.com/) 
where I helped build and support multiple backend analytics
services supporting a number of Fortune 100 companies.

In 2017 I moved to Seattle to help start Narrative Science's first west coast office, 
hiring multiple people and transitioning to a management role. My focus is creating a
healthy, productive team of engineers through clear communication and professional development.


My hobbies include biking, cooking, tinkering with electronics, and reading (mostly
sci-fi, fantasy, and philosophy).
